The Program Spec

Individual Assignment

Understand the Application

What it Looks Like to the User

The purpose of creating this application is to allow computer science students to download an application that will allow them to review computer science concepts and vocabulary. The focus will revolve around Java. Absolute Java (Sixth Edition) by Walter Savitch should be used as a reference. Each chapter that was reviewed in CST 338 should be included in this application. 



Phase 1: Design and create an Android App – Home Page
1.	The home page should include all the chapters that were reviewed in CST 338.
2.	A ListView should be created that highlight key points in each chapter. Use the textbook Absolute Java (Sixth Edition) by Walter Savitch to gather titles and information regarding the topics covered throughout CST 338. 
3.	There should be a button on the home screen that allows the user to search inside of google.com.
4.	The colors of the application should be unique for each tier. 
a.	An example would be the main page should be brown, the CH-1 screen background screen should be orange, and the screen inside the first topic of CH-1 should be a different shade of orange.
b.	Be sure to change the background of the textbox where information is being included for topics of each chapter.
5.	Students should be able to navigate through each different chapter by way of clicking buttons. Be sure to use onClick to be able to complete this.


Phase 2: Further Details Regarding Android App
1.	Each chapter from the list view should include 3 key topics or definitions.
a.	There should be one key idea incorporated into each of these chapters.
b.	Consider including vocabulary words for each chapter.
2.	Each key topic should go into detail. Make sure to choose a topic that a student would find useful. 
3.	There should be a back button included on each screen except the main screen.
a.	Each back button should lead back to the previous screen, and not back to the home page of the app.
i.	An example of this is:  if you are on the screen for the first topic of CH-1, the back button will lead back to the CH-1 screen. The back button on the CH-1 screen will lead back to the main menu of the app. 
4.	In total there should be 57 different screens. This will take time to create, so please plan accordingly.
5.	Be sure that button titles and functions make sense for the given chapters they are in. 
6.	Create XML’s that are connected to your files. 

Phase 3: Include Google Search
1.	Include a webpage on your home page. 
a.	Make sure that you are able to navigate through Google.
b.	The backbutton should also be included in this screen. 

Phase 4: Create a UML
1.	Create a UML for your Assignment
2.	Create a location in your application so that users can see the UML diagram.
